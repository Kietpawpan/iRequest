# iRequest
[iReQuest<sup>TM</sup>](https://kietpawpan.github.io/iRequest/index.html) is a prototype of Information Request e-service, to make it easier for people to write and send a request for information from a Thai governmental agency. They can start their requests by clicking a link to a draft email with prescribed e-mail recipient, subject, and body text, simplified from the governmental paper form for information request. Then, they may fill and send the e-request to the e-mail adress of DPS-MNRE (SLC). iRequest is best run on Windows and iOS devices but also support Google ones, by allowing the user to copy the prescribed text from the request form to paste in the email. The current version is still a prototype. Much remains to be done.
